This is very important to note, since in some cases, a city might not have any records for a certain product, for example, city '8e0eb10270d768f8' might never have had any records regarding the destined area for planting Sorghum. This means that accurately predicting this value is not possible. The best one may do, is to simply assume that it has always been zero, and as such, will remain zero. There is another case that is quite common, which is records starting at some point after the beginning of the records, and occasionaly faltering. In this case, where possible, we choose to interpolate the data to fill gaps, and assume it was 0 until the beginning of known records."

    "Now, for the training. This is done using an ElasticNet linear regression, with some basic feature engineering (adding polynomial features). This is useful, in case some of the progression haven't grown linearly with time, but instead quadratically, cubically, or really any polynomial up to a somewhat high degree (15 in this instance). It is worth noting however, ElasticNet enforces both L1 and L2 norms, which means, that the model will only use degree 15 if it is absolutely worth adding, seeing as these norms attempt to reduce the number of used features (which has several advantages, including the reduction of overfitting)."
